# Getting started {#getting-started}

This chapter X.

By the end of this chapter you will have R and R Studio installed, and be able to write and understand the following chunk of R code:

```r
good_number <- 10
big_product <- 999

one_to_ten <- 1:10
good_numbers <- c(10, 10, 20, 20, 40, 50, 60)

sum(good_numbers)
hist(good_number)
```

## Installing R and RStudio

Although you'll usually work with R by opening RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio separately. 

Install R by going to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. CRAN is a community-run website that houses R itself as well as a broad range of R packages.

You want to download the latest base R release, as a 'binary'. Don't worry, you don't need to know what a binary is.

For macOS, the page will look like this:

For Windows, you'll need to click on the 'base' version, and then click again to start the download.

Once you've installed R, you'll need to install RStudio. Go to the [RStudio website and install the latest version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) of RStudio Desktop (open source license).

Once they're both installed, get started by opening RStudio.
